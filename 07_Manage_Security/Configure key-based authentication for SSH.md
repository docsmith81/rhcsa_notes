### Configure key-based authentication for SSH
---
Public-key Authentication:
- To generate DSA keys, on the command line, enter:
  `ssh-keygen -t dsa``
- To generate RSA keys, on the command line, enter:
  `ssh-keygen -t rsa`

The keygen process:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
4a:dd:0a:c6:35:4e:3f:ed:27:38:8c:74:44:4d:93:67 demo@a
The key's randomart image is:
